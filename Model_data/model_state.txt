The trained model framework ultimately uses the following input variables:

- Lat,
- Long,
- Elevation (from 20m resolution DEM),
- Aspect (derived from DEM),
- Slope (derived from DEM),
- Aridity Index (Priestley-Taylor method; 20m resolution),
- Mean annual rainfall,
- Mean solar radiation,
- Cover Fraction (from Gill et al., 2017),
- Day of Year,

From the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Access-C NWP model (Puri et al., 2013), the following *purchaseable* data are used (product names are denoted within parentheses):
- Temperature (T_SFC),
- Relative humidity (RH_SFC),
- Sky cover (Sky_SFC),
- 75% chance of more than ? (mm) of total daily precipitation (DailyPrecip75Pct_SFC),
- 50% chance of more than ? (mm) of total daily precipitation (DailyPrecip50Pct_SFC),
- 25% chance of more than ? (mm) of total daily precipitation (DailyPrecip25Pct_SFC),
- 10% chance of more than ? (mm) of total daily precipitation (DailyPrecip10Pct_SFC),
- Probability (%) of any rain in day (DailyPoP_SFC),
- Apparent temperature (ApparentT_SFC),
- Dewpoint temperature (Td_SFC),
- Daily chance of at least 1 mm precipitation (%) (DailyPoP1_SFC),
- Daily chance of at least 5 mm precipitation (%) (DailyPoP5_SFC),
- Daily chance of at least 10 mm precipitation (%) (DailyPoP10_SFC),
- Daily chance of at least 15 mm precipitation (%) (DailyPoP15_SFC),
- Daily chance of at least 25 mm precipitation (%) (DailyPoP25_SFC),
- Wind speed (km/h) (WindMagKmh_SFC),
- Wind direction (degrees true) (Wind_Dir_SFC),

From AWRA-L v7 (Frost & Shokri, 2021; https://awo.bom.gov.au/products/historical/), the:
- Daily Actual evapotranspiration,
- Daily precipitation,
- Daily root zone soil moisture,

From the Australian Flammability Monitoring System (Yebra et al., 2018; http://wenfo.org/afms), the:
- Live fuel moisture content
